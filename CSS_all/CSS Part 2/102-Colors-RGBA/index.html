opacity affects the translucency of the Entire element and its children element. It affects everything and programmers cannot style the opacity of text color without affecting the background color of the element.!!!

Alpha on the other hand affects the translucency of the respective color field, either background-color or color only.It is more flexible and it does not affect all the elements
